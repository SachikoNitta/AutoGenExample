# AutoGen Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts that use AutoGen for various tasks.

## Virtual Environment Setup

This project uses a virtual environment located in the `venv/` directory.

### Activating the Virtual Environment

Before running any scripts, activate the virtual environment:

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Running Scripts

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can execute the Python scripts:

```bash
python capital_of_france.py
python fall_poem_group.py
python supermarket.py
```

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working with the scripts, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

- `capital_of_france.py` - Script related to French geography
- `fall_poem_group.py` - Script for generating fall-themed poetry
